# Design

This application will be designed to allow the user to track their time spend on certain areas and tasks.

## Requirements

(Applying my newfound engineering design process knowledge)

### Primary Function

- Track the user's use of time and provide feedback

### Secondary Functions/Objectives

- Set goals per day, week, month, etc. (how much time to spend on areas/tasks)
- Track use of time in real-time
- View time spent on areas/tasks this day, week, month, etc.
- Compare goals to actual use of time
- Actively provide suggestions and advice for time management

## General Development Stages

1. Start and stop a timer

2. Store a list of tasks and the time spend on each

3. Add a description and notes for each task

4. Group tasks into categories (e.g. courses, priorities)

5. View grouped time statistics (e.g. time spent on calculus this week)

6. Set goals for time to spend on categories/tasks

7. Interactively compare goals to results

8. Allow tasks timer to run in the background, provide notification reminders (e.g. take a break, 30 minutes elapsed)

9. Provide general notifications for time management tips
