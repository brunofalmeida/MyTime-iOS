# Design

This application allows the user to track their time spent on certain priorities and tasks.


## Requirements

### Primary Function

- Track the user's use of time and provide feedback

### Secondary Functions

- Time tasks in real-time or record tasks from memory
- View tasks by priority or a list of all tasks
- Analyze and graph time spent on priorities by day, week, month


## Version History

0.1: Start and stop a timer

0.2: Store a list of tasks and the time spent on each

0.3: Group tasks by priority, view each task's details


## Ideas for Future Features

- Set goals for time to spend on priorities per day, week, month, etc.

- Interactively compare goals to results

- Allow tasks timer to run in the background, provide notification reminders (e.g. take a break, 30 minutes elapsed)

- Actively provide suggestions and advice for time management (could be in-app or as notifications)
