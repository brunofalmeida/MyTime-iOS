- Track use of time in real-time
- View time spent on areas/tasks this day, week, month, etc.
- Compare goals to actual use of time
- Actively provide suggestions and advice for time management


## Version History

0.1: Start and stop a timer

0.2: Store a list of tasks and the time spent on each

0.3: Group tasks by priority, view each task's details


## Ideas for Future Features

- Add a description and notes for each task

- Set goals for time to spend on categories/tasks

- Interactively compare goals to results

- Allow tasks timer to run in the background, provide notification reminders (e.g. take a break, 30 minutes elapsed)

- Provide general notifications for time management tips
