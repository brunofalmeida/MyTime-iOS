# MyTime - iOS

An iOS application that helps you track how you're spending your time.

**Understand how you're using your time and reclaim it.**

## Inspiration

As a student, I can relate to those times where you spend a lot of time "working" but actually accomplish very little. With MyTime, you can figure out how you're actually spending your time and compare it to your goals. This application is initially aimed at students, but could potentially be used by anyone.
