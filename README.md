# MyTime - iOS

An iOS application that helps you track and analyze how you are spending your time.

**Understand how you're using your time and reclaim it.**

## Inspiration

As a student, I can relate to those times when you think you spend a lot of time working, but actually accomplish very little. With MyTime, you can figure out how you are actually spending your time on different priorities and tasks in your life.
